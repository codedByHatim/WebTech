          The surroundings of Lago di Como are a fine example of Renaissance colour, as the lake boasts an endless shoreline of iconic, timeless architecture through centuries of thoughtful and well-curated development. Thoughtful development sits at the heart of Crockett & Jones. Whilst the new collection offers something not seen from Crockett & Jones before with our new, Gum coloured rubber wedge sole, the entire collection remains made in England in our very own factory in Northampton, upholding the very ethos of the company.
